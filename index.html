                    Hello! Im Jonas and im a Web developer as well as a Android and iOS dev. 
                    Throughout my programming career i have created and polished various websites
                    be it small or comercially used websites.

        <h2>More About Me</h2>
        <p>
          My first experience in programming was unexpectedly in a basement under 
          a complex where I was briefly trained on HTML, CSS and some JavaScript code.
          Mind you this was around where covid struck so I had to absorb as much knowledge
          as fast as posible due to time constraints, but overall both of my tutors helped 
          me greatly in understanding the ropes of programming. Intrigued after this
          experience I decided to continue down this path into the next step which was
          working as a Web developer
        </p>
        <p>
          Thanks to some conections my parents were able to hook me up into the software
          department of my local gym in which I trained. The manager of the gym at that time
          gathered developers around the world (including me) to create an app which could
          guide the users training routine, showing his or her progress, calorie intakes, 
          training routines and even if showing the status of ones gym subscription. I was in
          charged of using their custom API to send the information from the backend towards
          the front-end. Needless to say I also touched some Design aspects of the app im proud
          of doing.
        </p>
        <p>
          After leaving the company due to reasons I wanted to formalize myself into actually
          becoming a certified developer, so I enlisted into a School in IES Las Galletas where
          I studied to earn myself a Higher Vocational Degree of Web App Developement. Here is
          where I further polished my Programming Skills learning PHP and using frameworks such
          as Laravel, using javascript to its proper potential using Vue.js and learning softwware
          systems overall, not only programming. It was here where i also began my 3rd working
          experience in a company they asigned me towards my closing of my Studies.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was tasked to work in Conectatec as a Web developer. Unexpectedly, the head developer
            who saw I had experience in working in mobile native apps thanks to my previous project,
            handed me a side project which they were tasked by a company to complete. It was the 
            creation of an app that managed "albaranes" or delivery notes that could control wether
            resources from delivery trucks where confirmed to be sent. Using React Native and some
            modules I managed to single-handedly finish the project in a span of 2 weeks. My only 
            regret was not been to polish the uix design. Other than that, I was tasked to modify
            some of their custom plugins in wordpress in their reservation engine called Roomclic.
        </p>
        <p>
            After a few months of working, I finished my contract and finally earned my Higher 
            Vocational Degree in Web App Developement in which im proud of earning. From here I decided
            to test my skills as an actual programmer and not as just a hobby. Looking forward to work
            alongside you!!
